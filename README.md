Owen:
- final play seems too powerful

Philippa:
- plants that can stack on each other? bamboo

Tom C:
- a version that is coop because killing each others plants seems unrealistic?
- make resist full damage not half, rounding down sucks
- monstera seemed too powerful for high resilience
- the last player kept winning
- infestation / mites as a negative card? theme item
- counting up points all the time can be a head fuck
- "the plant rescuer" by sarah gerard jones is a nice plant care book, lots of details and nice pics

Diggle:
- make tidy up remove the last card, not all of them in stack
- liked the bluffing version
