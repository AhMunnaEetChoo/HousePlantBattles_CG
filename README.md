# HousePlantBattles_CG
 1 on 1 card game


# Feedback

Owen:
- final play seems too powerful

Philippa:
- plants that can stack on each other? bamboo

Tom C:
- a version that is coop because killing each others plants seems unrealistic?
- make resist full damage not half, rounding down sucks
- monstera seemed too powerful for high resilience
- the last player kept winning
- infestation / mites as a negative card? theme item
- counting up points all the time can be a head fuck
- "the plant rescuer" by sarah gerard jones is a nice plant care book, lots of details and nice pics

Diggle:
- make tidy up remove the last card, not all of them in stack
- liked the bluffing version


Alternate win conditions:
2nd player can end the game, otherwise 2nd player can add 1 more plant (this may be too powerful so item?)
after the 9th plant is played players make a final bluff play, resolve the bluffs in order starting with final player first


Concept feedback from Rob:
colour instead of type is ace
art style is perfect blend of cute realistic
different palette of colour maybe? (Ollie is happy with it)
need more explanation text in places
use dice for numbers so we can view both ways around
resilience in black/white circle instead of green
points gold is good - star shape, victory pointy chubby star like a mario star
